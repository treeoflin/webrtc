        id="LintError"
        severity="Error"
        message="No `.class` files were found in project &quot;SRC_ROOT1&quot;, so none of the classfile based checks could be run. Does the project need to be built first?"
        category="Lint"
        priority="10"
        summary="Lint Failure"
        explanation="This issue type represents a problem running lint itself. Examples include failure to find bytecode for source files (which means certain detectors could not be run), parsing errors in lint configuration files, etc.&#xA;These errors are not errors in your own code, but they are shown to make it clear that some checks were not completed.">
